Mesh Manipulation Pack
by Martin Reintges
----------------------

This package enables you to create simple and fast but great mesh manipulation effects of any Mesh-Filter object. Can easily be used for Spawn and Die effects.
It supports Vertex and Face manipulation as well as an experimental "Split faces to objects" script.

Features:
- Vertex & Face manipulation
- Force effector objects
- Custom effector curves
- Multiple effectors
- Smart script setup
- Simple scripts for improved effects
- Experimental "Mesh Splitter" - split faces into objects

The package is still in development and is constantly improved with new scripts, requested by you.


Showcase
--------
Assets/MeshManipulation/Scenes/Demo1.unity -> Showcase of the 3 basics (face, vertex, split)
Assets/MeshManipulation/Scenes/Demo2.unity -> The video scene showing several effects as demonstration and inspiration


Nice to know
------------
The package has the basic mechanics implemented and now I am waiting for you to get feedback. What is it you are missing?
I am looking forward developing exactly what you need.
